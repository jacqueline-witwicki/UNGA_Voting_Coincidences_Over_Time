# UNGA_Voting_Coincidences_Over_Time
## A tool to analyze UNGA Voting coincidences between member states.

### USER GUIDE

> Voting coincidences measure how frequently two United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) member states voted together on all UNGA resolutions that came to a vote, in a given calendar year. 
> When two states vote together, one point is added to their coincidence score. When one state votes and the other abstains or is absent, half a point is added. When states vote in opposition, no points are added. 
> This coincidence total is divided by the number of resolutions that came to a vote (possible coincidence points) in the year. 
> This is the same methodology used in The Department of State Report to Congress on Voting Practices in the United Nations for 2020 Section 406 of Public Law 101-246 (22 U.S.C. ยง2414a), with the small difference that absences are treated the same as abstentions.

### FILE BREAKDOWN


#### INPUTS :

1. Country_Code_index.txt ->   
   * This file contains UNGA member states and their country codes. I wrote this file by hand using country codes in wourld_countries_2020.shp. 

   * It is used by DF_OUTPUT_EDIT.py to produce files with the (*YEAR*)_(*key1 COUNTRY*)_For_Map.csv naming convention.
                    
   
2. wourld_countries_2020.shp  ->    
   * This file joins with files that have the (*key1 COUNTRY*)_For_Map.csv naming convention on the three digit country codes.
   
   * This file contains polygon information that produces a map of the world with 2020 country borders.
  
   * This file is not included in this repository due to its size. It is produced by IPUMS International and can be downloaded by clicking the link at the top of the page [HERE.](https://international.ipums.org/international/gis.shtml "IPUMS International Shape File")
   

3. United Nations Digital Library Voting Data ->    
   * text_parser.py scrapes this data directly from the United Nations Digital Library Website and uses it to produce files with the (*YEAR*)_RAW_COIN.csv naming convention. 
  
   * The digital library contains UNGA voting data organized by resolution and year. It can be viewed [HERE.](https://digitallibrary.un.org/search?ln=en&cc=Voting%20Data&p=&f=&rm=&ln=en&sf=year&so=a&rg=50&c=Voting%20Data&c=&of=hb&fti=0&fct__2=General%20Assembly&fct__9=Vote&fct__3=2021&fti=0&fct__2=General%20Assembly&fct__9=Vote&fct__3=2021 "United Nations Digital Library")
   

#### PYTHON FILES:
    
1. text_parser.py ->   
   * This file scrapes text from the United Nations Digital Library website.

   * The user inserts the year that they are interested in gathing voting data from in line 36.

   * This file returns a CSV file with the naming scheme  (*YEAR*)_RAW_COIN.csv, which contains raw voting data on all resolutions for the given year.

   * The output of this code is the input of DF_OUTPUT_EDIT.py
                    
   
2. DF_OUTPUT_EDIT.py  ->    
   * This file uses the raw voting data produced in text_parser.py and stored in (*YEAR*)_RAW_COIN.csv to calculate voting coincidences between one member state and all other member states, for the given year.
  
   * The user inserts the year that they are calculating voting coincidences for in line 103. This year should also be reflected in the inpute file and naming of the output file.
   
   * The user inserts the country they want to calculate coincidences for, against the rest of all UNGA member states, as key1, in line 103. This selection should be reflected in the name of the output file.   
   
   * This file returns a CSV file with the naming scheme (*YEAR*)_(*key1 COUNTRY*)_For_Map.csv , which contains UNGA member countries, their voting coincidence with the key1 country as a decimal, the year associated with the input file, and their three digit numeric country code.
   
   * The output of this code is an input of For_Map_Joiner.py  
  

3. For_Map_Joiner.py ->    
   * This file concatenates a list of files produced by DF_OUTPUT_EDIT.py to create a file using the (*YEAR*)_(*key1 COUNTRY*)_For_Map.csv naming pattern. 
  
   * The user selects what files they wish to be included in the output, (*key1 COUNTRY*)_For_Map.csv.
   
   * (*key1 COUNTRY*)_For_Map.csv can be joined with wourld_countries_2020.shp from IPUMS International using Tableau to create outputs similar to those in the Tableau Public link above. 
  

#### OUTPUT FILES:
  
1. (*YEAR*)_RAW_COIN.csv  ->    
   * Files with this naming convention are outputs of text_parser.py and inputs of DF_OUTPUT_EDIT.py.  
  
   * These files contain each resolution for a given year and each UNGA member state voted.  In the file, Y indicates a yes vote by the column country for the row resolution. N is a no vote. A is an abstention. X is an absence.
  
  
2. (*YEAR*)_(*key1 COUNTRY*)_For_Map.csv  ->    
   * Files with this naming convention are outputs of DF_OUTPUT_EDIT.py and inputs of  For_Map_Joiner.py.  
  
   * These files contain the names of all UNGA member countries, their corresponding country codes, the year associated with the corresponding (*YEAR*)_RAW_COIN.csv input file, and their voting coincidence with the key1 country.
  
  
3. (*key1 COUNTRY*)_For_Map.csv  ->    
   * Files with this naming convention are outputs of For_Map_Joiner.py and inputs of the Tableau project, Voting Coincidences in the United Nations General Assembly Over Time.twb. These files can be joined with wourld_countries_2020.shp from IPUMS International using Tableau to create various visualizations.
  
   * These files hold concatenated information from all For_Map_Joiner.py input files used in their production.
